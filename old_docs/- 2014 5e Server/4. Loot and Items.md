# Loot and Items
## Gold & Mundane Items: Purchasing and Selling
Characters can buy basic, mundane items (such as armor, weapons, and adventuring gear) that are listed in the Player’s Handbook (PHB) for the price listed in the PHB. This only needs to be logged in the character tracking sheet. Characters can also sell these items for half of the price listed in the PHB.

Characters can also buy and sell mundane items in a DM’s world, through trp and live sessions. Any gold found within a world can **only** be spent in that world, unless it is given as player loot for a session. Gold and mundane items gained within a world (not recorded as official session loot) is exclusive to that world and is considered homebrew elsewhere.

Mundane items and gold may also be granted as rewards for live sessions. Items and gold gained in this way can be used anywhere and must be logged on the character tracking sheet and by the DM in the trade log.

## Magic Items
Magic items may be received in live sessions as rewards up to the gold value of the session loot and chosen from The Starry Shore Shopping List. Magic items received as live session loot may be used server-wide, but some DMs have restrictions in their worlds. Magic items may only be received and used by characters of the same or higher tier.  

Server-wide allowed magic items can be found in the <a href="https://the-starry-shore.github.io/-%202014%205e%20Server/-%202014%20Server%20Systems/1.%20Shopping%20Guide/" target="_blank"

</a>. Any item not on the shopping list is not allowed in The Starry Shore and is therefore considered homebrew within the server.

*P.S. Any item that has a recharge time longer than 30 Days is no longer rechargeable but is considered a consumable instead.*

### Notes about items
*   Some powerful items have had their properties altered. These altered properties can be found in their listing in The Starry Shore Shopping List.
*   Characters may only use the manuals that boost ability scores once.
*   Some of these items require a session to obtain, due to their lore and power (“session required” in the shop). However, a character must still pay the gold cost to obtain the item.  
    * A maximum of one session-required item can be obtained per session. 
    * Only one player may receive a session-required item per session.
	* This applies whether the item is bought or crafted, and it cannot be traded.
    * Session-required items cannot be traded.
    * Example: if 2 characters need the same item, they still need 2 sessions to do so.  

    These items are unique and important and it should be personalized and significant to the character gaining it, so to keep it like that, the session needs to be tailored about the character gaining it with exploration, combat, or solving puzzles, which can be more rewarding and immersive for the player getting it.  

*   The player may request the beneficial properties of artifacts, and ultimately the DM of the session will determine the item’s beneficial and detrimental properties. The same properties may not be granted twice on a given item.
* Artifacts' Save DCs: Replace fixed DCs (e.g., 17 or 18) with:
    - Spellcasting DC, if the wielder has one
    - If they don't: Constitution Mod + 8 + Proficiency Bonus
*   DMs may choose to rename the item, but both names must be logged.
*   Artifacts are limited to one per character except if prestige points have been used to purchase a second artifact slot.  
    * To change artifacts, a character must first destroy their current artifact in a session, then acquire a new one in another session.
    * You can rent a 3rd artifact slot, check out <a href="https://the-starry-shore.github.io/-%202014%205e%20Server/-%202014%20Server%20Systems/4.%20DownTime%20Points%20Guide%20%28DTP%29/" target="_blank"

## Shopping: Purchasing Magic Items via Live Sessions or TRP
DMs may permit players to discover shops within their worlds, either during live sessions or through text-based roleplay (TRP), and purchase items from these lists found in other tabs. In these shops, players can purchase magical and mundane items.

Shops are permitted to charge more than the cost in the shopping list but cannot charge less. DMs retain full discretion over the availability of items, including what items are available and in what quantities. If the items are not listed in the shopping list, they will be considered homebrew within The Starry Shore.

For players seeking to purchase items, there are two methods:  

1. During a live session, if the DM allows it, players can submit a list of items they wish to purchase. To find the price of these items, check here: <a href="https://the-starry-shore.github.io/-%202014%205e%20Server/-%202014%20Server%20Systems/1.%20Shopping%20Guide/" target="_blank"

  onmouseover="this.style.transform='translateY(-2px)'; this.style.boxShadow='0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)';"
  onmouseout="this.style.transform='translateY(0)'; this.style.boxShadow='0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)';">

2. Through TRP shops in the market district category or any other shops within TRP worlds, as well as VIP buildings. Players engage in TRP interactions to procure items and then send the list to the DM.

## Selling Magic Items via live session or TRP
Selling an item at 50% of its base gold value is free and does not require a check. It must be logged by a DM in the <span style="display:inline-block;
              background-color:#4b4d53;
              color:#ffffff;
              border-radius:6px;
              padding:4px 10px;

              font-weight:500;
              user-select:none;">#magic-item-log
</span>.  

Selling an item at 100% of its base gold value requires a check and costs DTP. The check is a Charisma (Persuasion) check with a DC equal to the item’s tier x 5. The DTP cost is also equal to the item’s tier x 5.  

Buffs on the selling roll in live sessions are the same as crafting ones. See <span style="display:inline-block;

## Sending Stone System
Every character is gifted a sending stone upon their arrival to The Starry Shore. Sending stones can be linked to the sending stone of any other The Starry Shore resident that you have met.  

Sending Stones use a "Contacts" system in place of needing to carry a half dozen or more stones. This way, a character in The Starry Shore only needs to physically carry a single sending stone. Make sure to gain the consent of the player whose character contact you wish to store.

## Boons
Characters may purchase from a limited selection of Epic Boons as detailed in the Boons spreadsheet for the gold listed. Characters must meet the listed level requirements. To purchase a boon, post in <span style="display:inline-block;
              background-color:#4b4d53;
              color:#ffffff;
              border-radius:6px;
              padding:4px 10px;
              font-family:'gg sans','Segoe UI',sans-serif;
              font-size:0.9em;
              font-weight:500;
              user-select:none;">#artifact-and-boon-purchase-log</span> using the provided template. A staff member must approve this purchase.   

A character may only have a maximum of three boons, except if you buy a prestige boon slot. Boons belong to the character, not the player, and cannot be transferred to another character.
