### Crafting DCs
The difficulty class (DC) of a crafting check depends on the tier of the item being crafted. The higher the tier, the harder it is to craft. The DCs for each tier are:

| Tier              | DC |
| ----------------- | -- |
| Tier 0 and Tier 1 | 11 |
| Tier 2            | 15 |
| Tier 3            | 19 |
| Tier 4            | 23 |
| Tier 5            | 27 |

### Crafting Costs
The cost of crafting an item consists of two components: gold and downtime points (DTP). Gold is the amount of money required to buy the materials and tools needed for crafting. Downtime points represent the amount of time required to complete the crafting process.

### Tool Proficiencies Needed
To craft an item, a character must have proficiency with the appropriate tool for the item type. The tool proficiency determines what kind of check is made to craft the item.
*P.S. In sessions, DMs have freedom to decide what stat is used*

### Crafting Outcomes
On a successful check, the item is crafted and the character spends the gold and DTP required for the item.

On a failed check, the GP and DTP costs are spent and the item is not crafted, however the character can attempt another check for an additional 1/4th the original GP and DTP cost.

### How to use tools
To learn a tool proficiency, use the command: **`!tool prof <tool_name>`**. 

For expertise, use `exp` instead of `prof`.

Example: **`!tool prof alchemist`**

To make a check with the tool, use the command: **`!tool <tool_name> <stat>`**

Example: **`!tool alchemist wis`**
