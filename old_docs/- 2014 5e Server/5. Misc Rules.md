# Misc Rules
## Pets
Pets will require a bonus action to command to take their turns (except movement) as a default rule in the server, unless the DM said otherwise If you have a companion via class feature like drakewarden or steel defender, your bonus action command can apply to both your pet and your companion

*   Pets can be a maximum size of Medium and maximum Challenge Rating of ¼ all the way down to 0 CR.
*   Pets may be of Beast, Fey, Fiend, Construct or Dragon type.
*   Pets must have an intelligence of 3 or lower.
*   A character is limited to one maximum CR ¼ creature or two maximum CR ⅛ creatures.

**P.S.** Only the first pet (for each character) gains the upgrades from boosting or subscribing, the 2nd pet will always be CR 1/8 without any upgrades.


**What happens when a pet dies? are they gone forever?**

Nah, they spawn back in the Shore to be picked up for the next session. But they are out for the current mission unless they're revived.

## Karma Points

### How to gain karma points
**For Players**  

*   When someone you invite to join the server reaches level 4 ==> 16 pts
*   Sharing a DND Beyond campaign with all the source books (not all the adventures lol) required to make a character ==> 12 pts
*(you can get another 12 points when the first one is full, so let's all agree that sharing is caring)*

**For DMs:**  

*   Becoming a full DM (one time thing) ==> 6 pts
*   Having a new player <strong style="background:#4b4d53; color:#32CD32; padding:2px 6px; border-radius:4px;">@Starling (New Player)</strong> (anyone who hasn't reached level 5 on any characters yet) in your session ==> 2 pts for each player
*   Running an open session when there's a lot of lfg ==> 2 pts (rewarded by the staff)

**For Counselors & Staff:**  

*   Helping a player correcting a creation log ==> 1 pts
*   Approving a creation log ==> 1 pts
*   Approving a respec log ==> 1 pts for each 3 lvls (Staff only)
*   Helping a new player through creating a character and typing a log ==> 4 pts

**Monthly Gain For Server Boosters & Subscribers:** (once each month)  

*   Noble Server Subscribers ==> 40 pts
*   Heir Server Subscribers ==> 20 pts
*   Steward Server Subscribers ==> 10 pts
*   Server Boosters ==> 10 pts (doesn't stack with multiple boosts)

### How to spend karma points
*   4 pts ==> 1 hour on any character
*   1 pts ==> 4 DTP
*   1 pts ==> GP (value depends on character you redeem them on)
    *   5k for T1 & T2
    *   25k for T3
    *   75k for T4
    *   150k for T5

- 30 pts ==> all players can buy up to 2 respecs for 30 karma points each, this will also reset at the start of January and July. Meaning if you already bought 2, you can buy another 2 more!
- 1 Karma point = 2 Prestige pts
- Players can also use karma points to get prestige points!!  
  You can pick from any of the taps except Others, Origins, and Racial Features!. (unless the character is already prestiged!)  
  **P.S.** You don't need to prestige to buy prestige stuff using the prestige points gained from karma points

## Clarification about The Shore nature & VIP building
The Starry Shore main bubble is created by the gods, and outside influence can't affect or harm shorians inside the bubble. If anyone (NPCs) not accepted by the gods enters, they immediately get disintegrated, unless they're lucky enough to be accepted to be a shorian (is converted into a PC). 

Some of The Starry City (VIP) buildings can be outside the bubble but still close enough to receive limited protection... but yes, having it outside the shore would expose it to risks (since some DMs use it for their own sessions.)

## Rules for Simulacrum, Demiplane and Glyph of Warding
Due to their high propensity for abuse in a Westmarch-style setting such as ours, we have server-wide rules for the spells Simulacrum and Demiplane:

1. Respec/Prestige also changes any active Simulacrum's statistics to reflect your new ones.
   
2. To bring a Simulacrum or use a Demiplane in a session, the character must be able to cast the spell on their own.
   
3. Simulacrums of other PCs can only be created with consent. These Simulacrums can only be brought in the session if the PC is also present and consents to it.
   
4. Simulacrums are unable utilize the *Simulacrum* spell.

5. Item Attunement Requirement: If the spell is cast through a magic item, the caster must be attuned to that item in the session.

6. Spell Gem Restriction: To imbue the Spell Gem, the character is required to know the spell. Other creatures cannot imbue a Spell Gem on your behalf.

7. Ruby Weave Gem: The spell learned through the Ruby Weave Gem and any ongoing effects of it are lost once the attunement is broken with it.

8. Any ongoing effect of an item ends once the attunement is broken with it.

Casting and interacting with these spells and their effects can take a considerable amount of time. As always, remember to spend and track DTP usage if you are using these spells outside of sessions.

***P.S.** Extradimensional Spaces created by items can not be used to store Glyph of Warding (e.g Bag of Holding, Portable Hole, etc)*
