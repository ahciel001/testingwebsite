## How Things Work here?
Player Characters (PCs) exist in The Starry Shore, an interplanar hub with the main street leading to many portals. Dungeon Masters create those portals leading to whatever worlds they dream up. PCs can visit those worlds via live sessions and/or text role play (trp). PCs earn levels and gold via hours played in live sessions. Characters continue to level past level 20 using the hours-played formula. Though their level will not increase any further, they will gain additional rewards for each level: 

* 21, 22, 23: An Epic Boon each
* 24: The ability to earn an artifact rarity item for your character 
* 25-30: A +2 increase to one ability score and its maximum.

## What kind of D&D we play here?
Most of the games offered here are exciting one-shots, perfect for those who love spontaneous adventures. There are a few DMs that host campaigns, Typically, they like to play a few sessions with new players to see if there’s a good fit. If they like your gaming style, they might invite you to join a campaign. This server mainly focuses on these one-shot games, which make up the majority of our activities, allowing you to play on your own schedule.

We’re proud to say that our community only includes the coolest players. That said, we embrace diversity in play styles. Whether you’re someone who revels in rich storytelling and immersive roleplay, or a strategist who enjoys optimizing characters to their fullest potential, you’ll find a welcoming space here. Everyone is invited to bring their unique approach to the game.

## Modes of Play:
1. **Live Voice Sessions:** You gain "hours played", gold, and items as rewards from playing. (We use "hours played" in place of experience for leveling up.) This is the **main** method of play. 
   And these kind of sessions can be anything, from lighthearted and funny to dark and serious.
   
2. **Text Roleplay:** or TRP, there's 2 types of it:
 - PBP/TRP in DMs worlds: This for casual trp, you can role play whenever you're free and the dm does the same.
 - Trp for fun: This is the trp that happens inside the starry shore (Crossroad category, Starry City category)
